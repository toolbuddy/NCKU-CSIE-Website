## Develop Guide
This project use [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as backend infrastructure.
We use a lot of tools to help develop (ex. Pug (HTML5), Sass (css)), and we have setup some basic rule to make our coding style unified.
Make sure you follow our convention before you submit a pull request!
Here are a few standard:
* ECMAScript ( JavaScript )
    * Using pure ECMAScript to build everything on our server.
    * ECMAScript6 syntax mainly used.
    * Camel form naming style.
    * Other rules can be check by running following commands:
        * Frontend: `npm run lint:js-frontend`
        * Backend: `npm run lint:js-backend`
    * Build ECMAScript files: `npm run build:js-frontend`
* HTML
    * Using Pug template engine.
    * HTML5 tags only.
    * Semantic tags only, don't use tags like `div`, `i`, `b`, etc.
    * Other rules can be check by running `npm run lint:html`.
    * Build HTML files: `npm run build:html`
* CSS
    * Using Sass.
    * CSS3 syntax mainly used.
    * BEM naming convention:
        * Block: Control layout of its elements (structure).
        * Element: Control outfit of itself (skin).
        * Modifier: Modified style of specific element.
    * Other rules can be check by running `npm run lint:css`.
    * Build CSS files: `npm run build:css`
* Git
    * Using Git flow as develop standard.
    * Following branches are used:
        * `master`: Major stable version.
        * `release`: Ready to release version, need test to be proof stable.
        * `develop`: Develop version, not yet ready to publish.
        * `feature-*`: New feature, may or may not be merge back to `develop`.
        * `hotfix-*`: Quick fix for major version.
